## Summary

If you've been using Godot for a while, you likely have several versions of the engine on your computer. This program is intended to declutter your desktop by accessing any version through a single executable.

## Instructions

Download the launcher from the releases section or export the project yourself using Godot 4.
Place the launcher and all executables in the same folder. Don't rename any of the Godot executables.
